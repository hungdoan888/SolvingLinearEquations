# Solving Linear Equations
- When solving systems of equations, specically tridiagonal systems, there are various methods that may be used. I will be discussing direct methods such as Guassian Elimination with and without partial pivoting and LU factorization on tridiagonal systems, and iterative methods such as Jacobi, Guass-Seidel, and Successive Overrelaxation method. I will also discuss the time complexity for solving these methods.
